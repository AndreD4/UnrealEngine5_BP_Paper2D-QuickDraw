# QuickDraw


# SHOWCASING


The concept is very similar to the quick draw mini game from the Kirby series where you have two Samurai

facing off and whoever draws their sword quicker is the winner.

Here I will show the basics of paper 2D and how we can set up our sprites, adjust the sort order.

Switch sprites during gameplay to go into the attack or defeated state and much more.

I was surprised at what kind of games you can actually create only using sprites without sprite sheets

and flipbooks.

I'll also talk a bit about inheritance and how we can use child blueprints to share certain functions

and variables between different classes and also keep the functionality of the player and the NPC separate.
